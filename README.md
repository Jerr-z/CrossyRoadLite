## Can the Chicken Cross the Road?

### Acknowledgement
This project has based its program structure on Mazen Kotb's Snake Console, available
at https://github.com/mkotb/SnakeConsole. <br>

<br>
A thrilling experience of simple yet challenging gameplay will be provided to
the users through dodging cars, avoiding obstacles and most importantly, crossing
the **ROAD**! Scores of users will be displayed in game for you. The game will be utilizing a very simple control
scheme of 4 direction inputs which allows you to control the avatar freely in a 2d
space.

<br>
This is a game that everyone can play! If you want to save yourself from boredom, 
whether it is waiting for the bus or having nothing to do in between classes or 
distracting yourself from English class (totally not me). Give this application a shot!

### Why is this project of interest to me?
<br>
The whole reason I went into coding is because of my passion for games. Being able to develop
a basic game will allow me to take on a different perspective that is
not simply a player and consumer, but rather as a creator and developer. I would get invaluable
insights into how object-oriented programming is integrated into somewhat complex system. Which
would serve as a stepping stone for future projects that could be way more robust.
